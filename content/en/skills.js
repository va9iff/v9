		explanation: `
			I started to learn JavaScript after Python. At this point I was 
			familiar with programming. Already learned HTML and css when i was 
			a kid. I just had to learn "how"s. So I made a curriculum for 
			learning how can I use JavaScript like Python:
				<ol>
					<li>How can I update</li>
					<li>
						How can I programmatically create <b>(XOU project)</b>
					</li>
				</ol>
			This was all I need indeed. Took only 1 project to get comfortable 
			with JS in less than a week of summer. Now I'm here :)

	Python: {
		explanation: `Python was my <i>real</i> experience of programming. I 
		made lots of games. My first real project was a card game from cli. The 
		game was build around the order of cards. Player selects one card each 
		turn. For example Fireball selected near Snow will "melt" snow cards. 
		Cards go down when the card below them is removed. Some cards could 
		be used at the end of the queue. I was realy happy with little CLI game 
		that I learned Tkinter. But this wasn't fun. Ended up looking like a HR 
		management app. So switched to Kivy. I could animate some properties 
		here. But that was the time when I realized Python isn't the greatest 
		choice for me... (see JS)`

	React: {
		explanation: `I usally don't use React for my projects. Lit is what I 
		consider in general as it's more performant. Lit also makes use
		of native custom element API instead of an abstraction. This website 
		is built with Lit with every component. <br>
		<br>
		But I learned React and used it for small projects. Using it isn't hard 
		for me at all. Lit is even harder to be honest with all these 
		directives :D So I'm putting it here. No React exclusive projects, but 
		I'm familiar with it.`

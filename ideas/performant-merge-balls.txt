I can't remember what this was called but concept is like this: 

when 2 balls gets near, they start to flow to each other like a fluid.
if close enough, they'll merge and when you put both balls center 
very close (they do collide) they'll smooth their parts and look almost like 
a single ball. or r/2 will make it look like a wavy ellipse.

that's very basic. to make merging:
you have two or many solid objects. (rectangle, circle, doesn't matter)
blur them all with a big radius.
increase the contrast.

lets say bg is black and objects are white.
and assume contrast will turn every pixal into brighter #fff or #000.
blur will make the pixels near to most ojbects brighter.
so pixels near most will be filled.
a few pixels away from filled one is also filled (for example, is #666)
but since this will be contrasted to #000, it'll look blank.
so we have a sharp edge of a solid object.
but also a curved shape, since the inner corners will be "filled".




to make it performant, instead of blurring it, we'll use blurred ones:
instead of using circle and blur, we'll directly use radial gradient.
instead of using rectangle, we'll use box shadow.
now we don't need big gaussian blur radius calculations and do only contrasting.

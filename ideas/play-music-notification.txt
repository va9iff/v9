notifications can be used for keeping the website alive

after 20 seconds, a notification would come and ask:
"Can I play some Lo-Fi chills? It's been too quiet."
<yes!> <no.>

and after you say yes, it'll bring a little player somewhere in the page.
the sound level should be lower and jenre is Lofi Hip-Hop

and another notification saying:
"Enjoy! These are what I'm used to listen."
<cool.>

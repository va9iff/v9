Just like the VSCode's side menu. everything with icons. this will make 
sidebar's width thinner. but when hovered, a tooltip should come with animation 
that names the item. we can use after with animation transform translate 
and opacity. don't forget to add no select and pointer events none to the after 
element.

this will also give familiar feelings to the reviewer if he uses VSCode.

the V9 is actually VA9IFF with A and IFF in a span with font size 0.
when you hover it, their font size will grow to normal.
since it's written from top to bottom, like

V
9

it'll grow to

V
A
9
I
F
F

and will push the buttons to bottom.

when you click it, the VA9IFF container will grow to take up full height
of the side bar and the buttons will disappear.
it'll stay in the center with the same font size with a little 
bit more line space. the sidebar will have gradients and clicking it again 
will make a big colored background VA9IFF text come from left with animation, 
cover and replace the whole content. clicking the VA9IFF that's come will make 
it go to left again.

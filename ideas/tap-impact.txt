the one I had in the previous portfolio. when you click, a buble appears and 
goes away. add a circle div with white inset shadow that grows in scale and 
opacity goes to 0.

a completely saperate div may overlay everything with no pointer events for 
this divs.

also moving mouse may make them move too.

different colors in different impacts.

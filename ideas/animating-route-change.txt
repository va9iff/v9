when headed to a new url it is handled by ourselves.
I update it 
from
/ 
to 
/projects.

so I can do this
/
/p
/pr
/pro
/proj
/proje
/projec
/project
/projects

or

/
/s
/ts
/cts
/ects
/jects
/ojects
/rojects
/projects

but, there's a big BUT that I'm not sure about:
can I animate without adding to history?
cuz if I can't, the user will have to go back every letter one by one :|

I found this
history.replaceState({}, 'Title', link.href);

(I realised I can't use /path in github but I could use #path aka hashroute)

ANOTHER SOLUTION 

since we can use back button, we can just add letters and then remove them by 
going back to where these wasn't added. (go back steps number of letters)
we also need to block moving the path while animating? or abort functionality?
anyways, idea is like this:

start #starting
pop   #s
pop   #ts
pop   #cts
pop   #ects
pop   #jects
pop   #ojects
pop   #rojects
pop   #projects
back()
back()
back()
back()
back()
back()
back()
back() (we're at the point before #s which is #starting)
pop #projects

the history:
#starting
#projects

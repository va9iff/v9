when headed to a new url it is handled by ourselves.
I update it 
from
/ 
to 
/projects.

so I can do this
/
/p
/pr
/pro
/proj
/proje
/projec
/project
/projects

or

/
/s
/ts
/cts
/ects
/jects
/ojects
/rojects
/projects

but, there's a big BUT that I'm not sure about:
can I animate without adding to history?
cuz if I can't, the user will have to go back every letter one by one :|

I found this
history.replaceState({}, 'Title', link.href);

instad of hovering turns black bg to white, we can:

hovering to an elment will a circle grow in this element with white bg.

this will give a fill efect.

but what if circle doesn't fill completely? using too big values would mess it up.

the bg turning white from dark will go with it simultaniously. but since the 
circle has 100% opacity, these parts will appear to be "already filled".

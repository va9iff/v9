this is a must.

I have a cool idea for "inverted" or "negative" border radius.

scroll bar would look like this by default:
|            |============|         |

with normal radius:
|            (============)         |

with "negative" radius:
|============)            (=========|

how?
a shadow with normal radius that starts at the end goes to the infinity end.
a shadow with normal radius that starts at the start goes to the infinity start.

I don't want to use js event listener for EVERY single letter. An easy way to 
make something like this is to split text to characters and wrap them in an 
element (preferably a span) and give a class. This class has 
:hover { transform: scale(0.87); opacity: 0.92; } 
I don't know if it's a bad idea, but 60 event listeners calculating distances on 
per should be havier than native hover checker. yes this will look more simpler 
but anyways

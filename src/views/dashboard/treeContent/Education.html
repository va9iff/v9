I am an ambitious and dedicated <b>cyber-security student nearing the

of Economics (UNEC) </b>. Scored above <b>80%</b> in
the placement exam, demonstrating my commitment to 
academic excellence. <br><br>

In my earlier years at university, I excelled with a 
remarkable <b>GPA of 96%</b>, showcasing my strong
